## About Me

</div>

I'm a PhD candidate passionate about unraveling the mysteries of bacterial communication, gene regulation and mutagenesis. My research sits at the fascinating intersection of **molecular biology** and **computational approaches**.

- 🎓 Currently working on my **PhD thesis** in molecular microbiology
- 🦠 Investigating the molecular mechanisms of **competence regulation** and **genetic transformation** in oral *Streptococci*
- 💻 Building computational tools to accelerate *in vitro* discovery
- 🧪 Bridging the gap between wet lab experiments and data analysis

## 🔬 Research Focus

| Focus | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🧫 Bacterial Signaling | Quorum sensing and peptide-mediated communication in microbial communities |
| 🧬 Genetic Transformation | Mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer and DNA uptake in bacteria |
| 🧪 Mutagenesis | Studying mutation pathways and their role in bacterial adaptation |
| 💊 Antimicrobial Resistance | Understand the relative weight of each adaptation mechanism's role in AMR propagation |
| 🦷 Oral Streptococci | Streptococci is a commensal pathogenic bacteria with rising frequency of AMR caused by its adaptability by both genetic transformation and mutagenesis |
